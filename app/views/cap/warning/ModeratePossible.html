    <p>This Flood Warning has been issued as large waves and high tides along the south coast have been removing shingle from Denge Beach, increasing risk of property flooding. Flooding is possible at high tide this afternoon between 12pm and 3:30pm, Tuesday 01/10/2019. Properties particularly at risk include the Coastguard Cottages and Midrips Cottages, East of Juryâ€™s Gap. Our staff are on site to replenish the shingle and will remain on site to assess further damage. High tides will continue to increase the risk of flooding until Wednesday evening, 02/10/2019. Our incident response staff have been liaising with emergency services. Please be careful along the beach, promenades, coastal footpaths and roads, as large waves and sea spray could be dangerous. This message will be updated by 21:00 on Tuesday 01/10/19, or sooner if the situation changes. More detailed information for those who need it: total water level for Rye is forecast to be 4.81mAOD at 13:45 on 01/10/2019.</p>
    <p>Flood risk area: Denge Marsh, including Coastguard Cottages and Midrips Cottages, East of Jury's Gap</p>
