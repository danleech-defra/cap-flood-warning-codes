    <p>River levels have risen at the Tenbury river gauge as a result of heavy rainfall. Consequently, flooding of property roads and farmland is expected from this morning Sunday 16/02/20. Flooding is affecting properties and roads at Tenbury Wells and Burford including the A4112 Market Street and Teme Street in Tenbury Wells. Levels at the Tenbury River gauge are expected to peak between 5 and 5.5metres on Sunday evening 16/02/20. Further rainfall is forecast over the next 12 hours. We expect river levels to remain high over the weekend. We are closely monitoring the situation. Please avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded. This message will be updated by 8am on Sunday 16/02/20, or as the situation changes.</p>
