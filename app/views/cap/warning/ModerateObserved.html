    <p>River levels are high but steady at the Welshbridge river gauge as a result of heavy rainfall. Consequently, flooding of roads and farmland is occurring. Flooding may affect offices at the showground and Gravel Hill Lane. Predicted peak at Welshbridge: 3.20m to 3.25m this evening, 02/10/19. We expect river levels to remain high until Thursday, 03/10/19. We are closely monitoring the situation. Please avoid using low lying roads and footpaths near local watercourses and avoid contact with flood water. This message will be updated by 9:00 am on 03/10/19, or as the situation changes.</p>
