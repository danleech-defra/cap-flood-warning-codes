    <p>Large waves are expected as a result of high tides. The forecast high water is 09:00 on Thursday 09/04/20 with a level of 8.04 mAOD and a Force 3 north easterly wind. All times are local and refer to the high water time at Avonmouth, mAOD is height above average sea level for more detail refer to local tide tables. Flooding to roads and farmland and properties is possible at these times, however conditions may apply one hour either side of the high tide. We believe there is a possibility of flooding for the coastline between Portishead Point and Avonmouth including Woodlands Road, Portishead Ashlands Nature Reserve and the Royal Portbury Dock. We are in a period of high Spring tides. We are closely monitoring the situation. Our incident response staff are closing flood gates. Please be careful along beaches, promenades and coastal footpaths and roads. This message will be updated on Thursday afternoon.</p>
