    <p>This Severe Flood Warning has been issued because river levels have risen at the Old Wye Bridge river gauge as a result of heavy rainfall.  Consequently, flooding of property and roads is possible today, Monday, 17/02/20. Please activate any property flood protection products you may have, such as flood barriers and air brick covers and have a bag ready with vital items like medicines and insurance documents. River levels at Old Wye Bridge have peaked at 6.11m midday today, Monday 17/02/20. Further rainfall is expected over the next 12 hours as a result of Storm Dennis. We expect river levels to remain high over the next couple of days. We are closely monitoring the situation. Our incident response staff are liaising with emergency services. This message will be updated by 4pm on Monday 17/02/20, or as the situation changes.</p>
