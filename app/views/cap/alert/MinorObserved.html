    <p>River levels are forecast to rise at the Brookvale Road river gauge as a result of persistent rainfall over the last 24 hours.  Consequently, flooding of roads is expected later this evening and throughout tonight 12/06/2019.  Flooding is likely to affect low-lying land and roads adjacent to the River Tame between Horseley Heath and Castle Vale and the Ford Brook between Walsall and Bescot. We expect river levels to rise overnight. We are closely monitoring the situation and have closed the gates at Atlas industrial estate as a precaution. Our incident response staff are actively monitoring river levels and the weather forecast. Please avoid using low lying footpaths and bridges near local watercourses. This message will be updated tomorrow morning, 13/06/2019, or as the situation changes.</p>
